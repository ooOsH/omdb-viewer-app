# OMDB Viewer App

OMDB Viewer is a Nuxt app built with Tailwind to search and view movies/series from the OMDB API

## Project Plan
With most projects I usually sketch out some wireframes for the intended UI/UX (if not designed already), I will write down the functionality I will need to build it - like API connections and composables, list modules/packages I will need. See below...

## Setup

### Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```
I personally use pnpm due to its speed and efficiency but any other package manager could be used just delete the lock file

### Run the app
Rename the env file to get the API key
```bash
sample.env to .env
```

### Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev -o
```

### Production
```bash
pnpm build
```

### Preview Production locally
```bash
pnpm preview
```
